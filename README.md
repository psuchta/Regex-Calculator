## RegexCalculator

It is a really simple project of a calculator. The purpose of creating this project was to learn some regex basics.  
We all know that the order of mathematical operations is really important. To keep this order I have used regular expressions. 
Basically, I search input for mathematical operations patterns. Firstly regex matches multiplay and divides operations, secondly, it matches subtraction and addition.
When the operation is matched, the algorithm extracts the numbers and makes appropriate operations. There are also patterns to prevent users from doing unallowable actions.

Through this project, I wanted to learn the basics of regular expressions.
## Used technologies/features:
